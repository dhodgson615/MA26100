## Lecture 1: Vectors

**Ex.**

- $P(x, y), Q(x, y)$ are two points in the plane. The vector from $P$ to $Q$ is the vector $\vec{PQ} = \vec{Q} - \vec{P} = (x_2 - x_1, y_2 - y_1)$.

- The vector $\vec{PQ}$ is the same as the vector $\vec{QP}$, but in the opposite direction.

- $\vec{PQ} = -\vec{QP}$

- Vector from $P$ to $Q$: $\vec{PQ} = \langle x_2 - x_1, y_2 - y_1 \rangle$

- $P(1, 2)$ and $Q(3, -5)$: $\vec{PQ} = \langle 3 - 1, -5 - 2 \rangle = \langle 2, -7 \rangle$

- The zero vector is the vector with both components equal to zero.

- The magnitude of a vector $\vec{v} = \langle a, b \rangle$ is the length of the vector, denoted by $||\vec{v}|| = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2}$.

- The direction of a vector $\vec{v} = \langle a, b \rangle$ is the angle $\theta$ between the vector and the positive x-axis, where $0 \leq \theta < 2\pi$.

- Magnitude/length of a vector: $||\vec{v}|| = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2}$

- Direction of a vector: $\theta = \arctan\left(\frac{b}{a}\right)$

- Addition/subtraction of vectors: 
  - $\vec{v} + \vec{w} = \langle a + c, b + d \rangle$
  - $\vec{v} - \vec{w} = \langle a - c, b - d \rangle$
  - where $\vec{v} = \langle a, b \rangle$ and $\vec{w} = \langle c, d \rangle$.

- Scalar multiplication: $c\vec{v} = \langle ca, cb \rangle$

- Notation: 
  - $\mathbb{R}^2 = \{(x, y) \mid x, y \in \mathbb{R}\}$ is the set of all ordered pairs of real numbers.
  - $\mathbb{R}^3 = \{(x, y, z) \mid x, y, z \in \mathbb{R}\}$ is the set of all ordered triples of real numbers.
  - $\mathbb{R}^n = \{(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n) \mid x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n \in \mathbb{R}\}$ is the set of all ordered $n$-tuples of real numbers.

- Circle: $x^2 + y^2 = r^2$

- Sphere: $x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = r^2$

- The dot product of two vectors $\vec{v} = \langle a, b \rangle$ and $\vec{w} = \langle c, d \rangle$ is $\vec{v} \cdot \vec{w} = ac + bd$.

- The dot product of two vectors is a scalar.

- The cross product of two vectors $\vec{v} = \langle a, b \rangle$ and $\vec{w} = \langle c, d \rangle$ is $\vec{v} \times \vec{w} = ad - bc$.

- The cross product of two vectors is a vector.

- The cross product of two vectors is perpendicular to both vectors.

- The cross product of two vectors is perpendicular to the plane containing the two vectors.

- The cross product of two vectors is a vector with magnitude equal to the area of the parallelogram spanned by the two vectors.
